Jibx Acquired Knowledge

- If any required property is null, jibx may throw null pointer while marshaling. For example, if Project's id is configured as required and it is null.

- Jibx show error message like, expected tag is <...> and found <...> if,
-- Value style attribute is wrong
-- If you forgot to give the name of structure in a mapping and it was expected there
-- If Jibx is unable to resolve the values from mapped (map-as) structure due to any reason

- You can not use an abstract mapping as structure even if corresponding class is concrete. Jibx expect that if mapping 
is defined abstract, then the run time mapping object should be inherited from this abstract mapping class. If it is 
same class object, jibx will throw error. For example, You have Project and its Super class as 'CompactProject'. You 
have defined mapping for CompactProject as abstract and extends Project mapping from CompactProject Mapping. Now Issue
object and mapping has reference of CompactProject. So if you try to use CompactProject mapping as structure inside 
mapping of Issue, and runtime object is also of CompactProject type, jibx will give error that Runtime object should be 
bind with some extending class of CompactProject.

-We also face problem in following scenario. Like Project default mapping is having 'element' value style. But if we 
want to use this mapping in inside structure of Issue, where value style will be 'attribute'. It wont work even if we 
set the value style as attribute with that structure. Refer to RedmineBDO object java comments for more detail.
