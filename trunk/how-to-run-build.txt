What and Where:
------------------------
API jar File - Under dist folder
API Java Documentation - Under javadocs folder
Dependencies/Libraries - Under lib folder
License Information - In license.txt file
Reference Implementation - Refer to test cases bundled with source code. You can get the source code from SVN repository

How to Run:
------------------------
Get the vts-redmineconnector.jar from dist folder
Get libraries from lib folder
Add these to your project libraries
Have redmine-connector.properties in classpath at root 
Set the properties in redmine-connector.properties file for server address and security key
With latest version, you can specify these properties while initiating the instance of RedmineConnector class in constructor
Use the API
For reference implementation, refer to test cases bundled with source code

How to Build:
------------------------
Check out source code from SVN
Build the System using build.xml. It is ANT based build
Use javadoc target in build file to generate the latest Java Documentation
Use dist for building the jar file
Use run-tests for testing the project

Points to Consider:
------------------------
Application is current tested on Java 6. 
If you are trying to build it on Java 5, it may require some more jar files for XML parsing like Stax and Pull parsers.
